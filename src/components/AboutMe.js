            Hello! I'm Michael Reyes, a former Aircraft Director in the Navy transitioning to a coding career at Learn Academy.
            Drawing on my military background, I've cultivated precision and composure under pressureâ€”skills I'm eager to apply
            in the dynamic world of web development. Much like overseeing aircraft on the Flight Deck, I find excitement in bringing
            order and efficiency to digital experiences. As I navigate Learn Academy's curriculum, I'm mastering languages such as
            Ruby on Rails, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL. Proficient in test-driven development, I embrace collaborative
            and adaptable approaches. My military experience equipped me with leadership and problem-solving skills, now channeled into
            creating intuitive digital experiences. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging these skills to make a meaningful impact as a
            software developer.
